# The Compost Bin :)

>    The goal of this Compost Bin repo is to consolidate my programming projects from a variety of courses I took while in university. These projects exemplify my progress through school and the foundation that my software development practices are built on.
>    
>    Projects were pushed (for the most part) in the order of oldest to newest, and the semester they were created for is listed in a comment block at the top of project files.
>
>-Projects that have more than one file dependencies (use header files, make files, etc.) are put into directories to keep associated files together. If a file is not in a folder/directory then it is a stand-alone project even if file names seem related.
>
>-Some projects utilize base code provided by professors that was not created by me. I have done my best to document within the code where my work starts and ends.
>
>-There probably is a direct correlation between the rate of *feral* comments and the semester projects were done during.
