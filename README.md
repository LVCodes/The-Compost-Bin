# The-Compost-Bin

    The goal of this Compost Bin repo is to consolidate my programming projects from a variety of courses I took while in university. These projects exemplify my progress through school and the foundation that my software development practices are built on.
    
    Projects were pushed in the order of oldest to newest, and the semester they were created during is listed in a comment block at the top of each project file.
    -Projects that have more than one file (use header files, make files, etc.) are put into directories to keep associated files together.
    -Some projects utilize base code provided by professors that was not created by me. I have done my best to document within the code where my work starts and ends.
    -There is a direct correlation between the rate of **feral** comments and the semester projects were done during.
