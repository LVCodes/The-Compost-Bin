Lauren Vogel    COP4530    Fall 2020

This project will be implementing an undirected weighted Graph ADT and performing Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices. The graph can be implemented using either an adjacency list, adjacency matrix, or an incidence matrix. The graph will implement methods that add and remove vertices, add and remove edges, and calculate the shortest path. Each vertex in the graph will have a string label that will help identify that vertex and the test file.

A large portion of this assignment is researching and implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm. There is information about this algorithm in the textbook and widely available on the web.

Though it may be appealing to use an adjacency matrix, it might be simpler to complete this algorithm using an adjacency list for each vertex. It's suggested to use a separate class for the edge and vertex. Remember to write a destructor for the graphs!
